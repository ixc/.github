Hi! Welcome to the IC. Nice to meet you.

We make web software for clients â€“ some of whom are pretty large museums and galleries. 

The code we publish on Github is stuff we've made that makes our job easier. We hope it makes your job a little easier too.

If you run into trouble, open an issue on the repo. We welcome PRs on any public code.
